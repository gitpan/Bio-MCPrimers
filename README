2. Installation

MCPrimers.pm         - Place into Bio/MCPrimers.pm
                       Use the perl site directory for Activestate
CloningVector.pm     - Place into Bio/Data/Plasmid/CloningVector.pm
                       Use the perl site directory for Activestate

mcprimers.pl         - Front end CLI script. Make available to users.
mcprimers_gui.pl     - GUI. Make available to users.

MCPrimers_manual.doc - a Word format user manual.

You WILL want to wrap the .pl files with a shell script or batch file
so that the environment variables can be set. Remember that pl2bat
on XP (Activestate) will make a batch file. You can edit the resulting
file and add environment variables. Example files are provided.

pET-32a.txt  - Put in data dir.
It is OK to make your own vector data files using this format.

MCPRIMER_DIR - Set this environment variable to point to the directory 
               containing mcprimers.pl                   
PRIMER3_DIR  - Set this environment variable to point to the directory 
               containing the Primer3 executable.

MCPrimers defaults environment variables to its starting directory.

mcprimers.acd - provided for EMBOSS users 
                not tested in actual EMBOSS environment

MSWindows - use primer3.exe
Other OS  - use primer3_core

It is easiest to test and install mcprimers.pl & modules first
then test and install the GUI.

Note: Use perl -Ilib if modules are still in local lib directory.

3. Purpose

Creates molecular cloning PCR primer pairs for a given gene so that the
gene can be directionally inserted into a vector, which is defined in
an external data file.

Solver is generic, restriction enzymes and their order in the vector 
are specified in the data file specified.

4. Test Results (V2.5)

t/test.pl will test the release when run from a command line

Passes test.pl clean on Windows XP with Activestate Perl 5.8.7
Passes test.pl clean on MacOSX with Activestate Perl 5.8.8
Passes test.pl clean on Linux with the standard installed Perl 5.8.7 

The GUI was tested (OK) on XP and OSX.

mcprimers.acd was checked on XP with acdc.exe and acdverify.exe
mcprimers.acd was NOT checked in an actual EMBOSS environemnt
