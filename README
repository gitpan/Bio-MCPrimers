Primer3 is called by this code to verify that the PCR primers are OK.

2. Installation

MCPrimers.pm     - Place into Bio/MCPrimers.pm
CloningVector.pm - Place into Bio/Data/Plasmid/CloningVector.pm
mcprimers.pl     - Front end script. Make available to users.
pET-32a.txt      - Use in working dir or specify MCPRIMERS_DATA_DIR
                 - It is OK to make your own plasmid data files
PRIMER3_DIR      - Set this environment variable to point to diectory 
                   containing Primer3 executable.

If PRIMER3_DIR is not set, MCPrimers will set it to '.' by default.

MSWindows - use primer3.exe
Other OS  - use primer3_core

The code can be run in the download directory 
if an installation is not
desired.


3. Purpose

Creates molecular cloning PCR primer pairs for a given gene so that the
gene can be directionally inserted into a vector. 

Solver is generic, restriction enzymes and their order in the vector 
are specified in the data file specified.

4. Use

Use: perl mcprimers.pl [options] -vector file_name orf.fasta > result.pr3

Options: [-h] [-shift search_shift] [-clamp (both | 3prime)]

-h        help
-vector   cloning vector file name
-shift    integer value to shift search of left RE match into gene
          use -shift 12 (or other value) if initial search fails
-clamp    GC clamp
          'both' will clamp last NT at both ends to G or C (default)
          '3prime' will clamp last NT on 3' ends to G or C
          
Example:  
 
perl mcprimers.pl -vector pET-32a.txt -shift 12 \\
                  -clamp 3prime cysS.fa > cysS.pr3

Note:        Use perl -Ilib if the modules are still in the local lib dir.

Limitations: Does not account for redundancy codes in FASTA files.

Note:        These runs use intermediate files. This means that
             CGI or other use that can overwrite these files is
             a bad idea. 

5. Test Results (V2.2)

Passes test.pl clean on Windows XP with Activestate Perl 5.8.7

Passes test.pl clean on OSX with Activestate Perl 5.8.8

Passes test.pl clean on Linux with the standard installed Perl 5.8.7 

Note that HIcysS.fa and pet-32a.txt file need to be written out in 
the right text format prior to running test.pl (ie. MSW or Unix)

OSX with non-Activestate Perl (5.8.1) there are different results each time 
from mcprimers !?
