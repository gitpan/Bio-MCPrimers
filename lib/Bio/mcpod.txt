NAME
    Bio::MCPrimers

DESCRIPTION
    Creates molecular cloning PCR primer pairs for a given gene so that the
    gene can be directionally inserted into a vector. Solver is generic,
    restriction enzymes and their order in the vector are specified in the
    caller.

EXPORT SUBROUTINES

        CloningVector.pm - Place into lib/Bio/Data/Plasmid/CloningVector.pm
        Vector files     - Make vector file directory accessable
        mcprimers.pl     - Place in a directory where it can be accessed 
        mcprimers_gui.pl - Place in a directory where it can be accessed 
        mcprimers.acd    - Put in acd directory for EMBOSS 
                           Only checked with acdvalidate 
    
        MCPrimers_manual.doc    - User documentation
    
        MCPRIMER_DIR     - Set this environment variable to point to the 
                           directory containing mcprimers.pl  
        PRIMER3_DIR      - Set environment variable to point to Primer3 
                           executable directory.
    
        MSWindows - use primer3.exe
        Other     - use primer3_core

ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
    Primer3 is called by this code to verify that the PCR primers are OK.

    Thanks to Tim Wiggin for good ideas at the start. Tim rewrote
    CloningVector.pm in 2006

    Thanks to Dan Clemans for showing me molecular cloning in the first
    place. I am using Dr. Clemans's ideas about good MC primers in this
    code. Any errors in interpretation or implementation are mine.

    Patricia Sinawe found that earlier versions of MCPrimers did not detect
    out-of-frame solutions and suggested that extra binding sites could be
    included.

    Ken Youens-Clark has provided guidance in the proper naming of this
    software so that it functions cooperatively with other Perl modules.

    Anar Khan and Alastair Kerr for their advice at BOSC 2006 regarding
    EMBOSS compatability, Primer3 parameters, and selective use of sites.
